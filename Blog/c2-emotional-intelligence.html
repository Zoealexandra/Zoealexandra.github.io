        <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
        <p>
           The science behind the findings in the book are particularly interesting, for the deck of cards
            study, it really helped to highlight the physiological effect of emotions on the body. I find 
            the idea of being able to manage this somewhat as I work through thr book to be exciting, and 
            I'm looking forward to being able to measure other benefits I find I'm able to achieve.

        <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
        <p>
           I found the two minutes to be relaxing, but I 
           found my mind wanders very easily, and it was difficult to bring it back to my breath. 
           In a way this makes it easier to see my progress as I 
           try this in future, to see how far my mind wanders, and how easy it is to bring it back.
