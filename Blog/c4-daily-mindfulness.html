          <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'?</strong><br/>
            I learnt the importance of paying attention and the effect it can have on the speaker. 
            When I was the speaker, it improved my confidence when speaking to know the listener was paying attention to what I had to say, 
            even if I ran out of words to day on the topic. I somtimes find myself adding to conversations when someone else speaks if I have had a relevant
             experience, but I would like to learn to control this better, and just allow there to be silence in between, to give the other person
             sufficient time to speak. 
          <br/>
          <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong><br/>
          I think all three, listening, looping and dipping will be usful in sustaining my practice. 
          Looping in particular, as this would be a strong skill to acquire to ensure communication is kept to a high standard in many different envornments. 
          <br/>
          <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br/>
          I enjoyed the idea of making the medidation a challenge to yourself. For example, setting the bar low at first, and once this has been achieved, 
          tackling a more complcated goal.
