        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

            Got blocked on a simple problem
            Solved a problem in an elegant way
            In both cases:  What was the problem?
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
            How did you feel throughout the process?
            What did you learn?</strong>
            <br/>
            1. In the most recent challenge of this assignment (assignment 5), where I needed to enable a counter that was activated when certain conditions were met, I was struggling to write the code successfully. 
            There wasn't anything obviously wrong, so I went through the code separately, I suppose the technique would be trying something, as in trying the code without certain parts to see if it would work correctly. This helped to highlight
            which section wasn't corect. It was frustrating at first, but I felt better once the issue was localised to one line. It ended up being an additonal bracket that caused the issue. I learned from this that doing small checks for syntax, can be 
            faster and help in the long run visually, if when looking at a problem i can identify it easier, then going through and making any changes. 
            <br/>
            2. Another recent problem I had, was adding a hover action change to the main blog icons on my blog site. When a user hovers over the blog posts, the posts turn a shade darker. 
            The problem I found was that i couldn't link the action to the circle blog icons to make them work. To solve the problem, I googled some tutorials on how to achieve this, and found it was a lot simpler then I thought. 
            It was easier for me to understand the issue and correct the code I had written, once I had watched the explanantions in the tutorials. I learnt that some tasks I find learn easier through watching, then through reading an example. 

        <br/>
        <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong><br/>
        <strong> Pseudocode</strong><br/>
            I've found pseudocode to be a useful problem solving technique, and although I still find I make mistakes using this method, practice make perfect, and I believe the more I use this technique, the better it wil work for me. 
        <br/>
        <strong> Trying something</strong><br/>
            I often try something different to see which part of the code is working and which isn't, so this would be a confident problem solving method for me. 
        <br/>
        <strong> Rubber ducky method</strong><br/>
            I haven't used this method much, other than in our previous technical blogs, but I think it could be useful in future, and is one I'd like to practice more. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Reading error messages</strong><br/>
            I am less confident reading error messages to solve problems, simply because of my lack of experience with error messages. I think in future, with more repetition and familiarity with error messages, this will be a good way to problem solve for me. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Console.logging</strong><br/>
            I would use console logging as a process to problem solve if consle logging is already in the code I'm building, otherwise, I might be less confident using this as a problem solving method 
        <br/>
        <strong>Googling</strong><br/>
            This is the most commo problem solving technique I've used, although It may be one of the ones I am least confident with. I believe thi is becasue I am still becoming familiar with the terminology used, and once this is more second nature, it will be easier to use a googling technique. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong><br/>
            I always try to problem solve myself before I ask for help, and using some of the other tools in this list has worked for me so far. I know that in an environment where I was working with others in person, I would be more confident to ask others for help. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br/>
            I feel confident asking coahes for help, but only in cases where I had exhausted all of my other options. There are a lot of resources to help at phase-0, so I'm confident I could help myself and learn better this way. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong><br/>
            I'm not as confident with this process, as I often feel that there is always room for improvement, so always feel I could do more, and so reflecting can be never be clear on what I could do better or have done well. Pausing to reflect is something I find difficult, but I'm focusing on this more, and hope to improve the value from my reflecting over time.
