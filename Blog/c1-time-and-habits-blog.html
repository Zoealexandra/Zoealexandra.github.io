    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <br/>

    <p>
        <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        I tried the Pomodoro technique, which I feel works best for me with the reward at a given time period. I feel this will help to form a better habit of continuous work over time.

    <br/>

    <p>
        <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
        I think the simplistic nature of the technique interested me. It didn't involve much effort to try it, but the impact it has can be significant.

    <p>
        <h2>What worked for you? </h2>
        I found it was easier to motivate myself with rewards for specific tasks and time periods.

    <p>
        <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        I'd like to incorporate meditation into my daily routine too, starting in small blocks.
