    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <p>
        Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br/>
        I tried the Pomodoro technique, which I feel works best for me with the reward at a given time period. I feel this will help to form a better habit of continuous work over time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What did you find interesting? <br/>
        I think the simplistic nature of the technique interested me. It didn't involve much effort to try it, but the impact it has can be significant. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What worked for you? <br/>
        I found it was easier to motivate myself with rewards for specific tasks and time periods. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Which will you experiment further with?<br/>
        I'd like to incorporate meditation into my daily routine too, starting in small blocks.
