        <strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong><br/>
        I have tried recently to be more open and speak up about ideas, rather than keeping them to myself. I felt this went well, as initially I would keep quiet in fear of rejection of ideas, but the amount of rejection was exaggerated in my mind and so my sense of trust in this scenario was improved.
        <br/>
        <strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong><br/>
        I found the Loving Kindness exercise was helpful to try before working on this exercise. Then, when I was listening empathetically, I had more focus on identifying the feelings of the speaker. I was able to judge the feelings of the speaker more accurately then I would have thought, had I simply been listening in a general sense. 
        <br/>
        <strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong><br/>
        I found the exercise to be rewarding, in terms of identifying the perspective it gives on how you feel internally about someone you care about, and how this is not often said out loud. I wouldn’t ordinarily say this sort of thing to a friend out loud, but the feeling of happiness when saying these words, highlights (as mentioned in the book), that the feeling of happiness is experienced by both the person speaking, and the recipient.

        When a flatmate was leaving our house, they had caused some damage to the house, and they had said they had no intention of fixing it. They were the holder of the bond & lease, and we had said that we weren’t comfortable taking over the lease as the damage would then be our responsibility. We felt this was correct as it wouldn’t be fair to leave others with an issue you had caused.
        <br/>
        When looking at this from the perspective of the leaving flatmate:
The damage was caused by accident, and having been on the lease, they had put themselves in a position where they were legally liable for any other damage caused by the other flatmates. So they had seen this as doing a favour to everyone else, that could be paid back by them fixing the damage for them. They also didn’t know how to fix the damage and whether it was significant enough to fix.
        <br/>
        <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br/>
        I found the highlighting of the importance of trust to be interesting. I see how important trust is to the dynamics of a team, and feel motivated to use this in future where I have issues in teams moral, or inclusiveness.
