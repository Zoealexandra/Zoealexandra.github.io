        <strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong><br/>
        I have been privileged to have primarily compassionate management in my previous roles. In one or two roles where this had not been the case, I can feel the impact of this on my performance. For me, having a compassionate manager gives me motivation to succeed, for more than just myself. I’l have a better overall memory of the workplace and people from places where leadership has shown more compassion.

        <strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong><br/>
        I found this to really highlight the power of positive thinking. As you’re trying to conjure up so much positive energy during the exercise, you can see the value in completing this in different circumstances where goodness is needed. This also helped increase a positive perception of others.
        <br/>
        <strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong><br/>
        I found the Tonglen meditation to be similar to the last exercise, although I struggled to think of someone who is suffering from anything significant, so perhaps the impact of this exercise on me was less significant. There are different ways of suffering, so I think with some more thought, I could come up with better examples than the one in which I used in this case.

        <strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong><br/>
        The SCARF model is very relatable to my Phase-0 experience so far. I think the lack of certainty has definitely contributed to some stress during this time, be it from uncertainty of content I am learning, or how long an activity might take, or when I will be able to put aside enough time to complete an activity. In terms of Autonomy, I’ve had less control over the environment, but it is well structured, so I feel this hasn’t been a hinderance for me. Relatedness and status have been less of an issue for me. I have tried not to compare myself to others in phase-0, but I think this could be a factor for bootcamp. Although we all learn differently, it will be natural to compare my abilities to others. I’d like to keep in mind as much as possible, that I only really need to compare my abilities to myself, and how I have grown and what I have learned in the process. 
        <br/>
        <strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong><br/>
        Difficult conversations are a real struggle for me, I think learning to balance the compassion with respect and confidence is what I need to work on in these cases. My difficult conversation went better than expected, thinking from an external perspective, of the recipient of the conversation, I wanted to say what I needed to say as objectively as possible. This came across in the conversation, so there was minimal conflict. This exercise was important to me, as I’d like to increase my confidence when it comes to speaking up about things that are important, but often avoided due to fear of conflict. 
        <br/>
        <strong> Any other musings?</strong><br/>
        I enjoyed the insight into good leadership, and the examples given provided interesting points around how good leadership is perceived, and how anyone can improve their approach to leadership with the steps given.
