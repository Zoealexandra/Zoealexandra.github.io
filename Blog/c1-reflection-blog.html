      <h1>Reflections</h1>
      <br/>

      <p>
        <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
        I believe that the EDA experience is more than just learning to code, it's also about learning how to learn, and take care of yourself and understand yourself while doing so. I feel it's clear that you'll ultimately get out of the experience, what you put into it. 
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        It appears that a lot of thought has gone into the process of learning, which is important to me as someone who will be investing a lot in the course. It's good to see the encouragement of a positive environment, as I feel that can be applied to different areas of our lives. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2> 
        I feel there will be challenges with the level of group work, purely because I haven't had to manage this type of environment as consistently in my previous roles and studies. 
        I'm also excited to see where I find I can excel, as well as learn about how I can improve myself, so I'm prepared to go into this with an open mind. 
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        I don't think my expectations of EDA have changed, but more so the expectations of myself, and how I can make the most of the opportunity. I feel more motivated, and excited about my future. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        I am excited, and nervous, but I also really enjoy challenges, and I am ready for this challenge. I'm looking forward to wrking with others who want to better themselves, and learn more about how I can be better myself, by working with those in my cohort.
