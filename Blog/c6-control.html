          <strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong><br/>
          If I repeatedly make the same mistake, I find this can be a trigger for me. Also when working on an element for an extended period of time, but not making much progress - this also can be a trigger. 
          <br/>
          <strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong><br/>
           I found the exercise to be useful, taking the time to process what is happening helps to avoid regrettable actions. It was a lot easier to complete this in hindsight, as having the time to go through each step carefully, resulted in a calmer and more objective response. In real time, as mentioned in the chapter, the steps are completed within a few second or miliseconds. Being able to identify the steps leading up to the trigger, which can be done I believe in the cases mentioned above, will help to habitualise the steps for this exercise, and allow me to remain mindful and deal with these issue when they occur.
