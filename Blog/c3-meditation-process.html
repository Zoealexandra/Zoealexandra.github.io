        <strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong> <br/>
        I found it a challenge to ignore how the site looked, while testing the process side of things, and ensuring it
        was functional. I would say this is due to the product side of things is easier for us as this stage of learning, 
        as we can easily get stuck on the proccess side of things. I would expect this to become more natural as I become more familiar
         with different types of functions and how they work.
         <br/>
         <strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong> <br/>
         I thought that medidation would be a more difficult concept, and that the struggle in the beginning would be a deterrent
         to practicing.
         <br/>
         <strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong><br/>
        I have learnt that even small sessions of meditation, can contribute to your improvement in the practice. I've also learnt
        that pulling your mind away from distraction, can take time to learn, and that little and often can be a good way to improve this over time. 
         <br/>
         <strong> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong><br/>
         I think some of the more traditional techniques, such as sitting cross-legged, made sense to me as i've participated in this
          type of mindfulness at yoga before, but never felt I was participating as best I could. I think that using some of the traditional
           techniques for posture, can help distinguish any worries of 'doing it wrong' and I can instead focus on keeping my mind clear. 
           <br/>
         <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br/>
        The science behing medidation is something I find really fascinating. It really makes me wonder how medidation isn't intertwined into
         workplace wellbeing, in the same way as a gym membership, or health insurance. I think the effects can only really be non-existent, or postive, 
         rather than having any negative repurcussions.
