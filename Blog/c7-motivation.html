        <strong> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong><br/>
        These are three types of happiness, that vary in sustainability. The pleasure type of happiness is more difficult to sustain, and is about constant moving from one thing that makes you happy to another.If you only concentrate on the big things that make you happy, you may miss out on the smaller good things. The second type is Passion. Passion as a type of happiness is more consistent, and has a flow pattern that allows you to always enjoy the small things. The last type is Higher Purpose, which is more about understanding the happiness in your surroundings, and having that reflect on you. This seems to be the ideal type of happiness, and is described as being resilient and lasting a long time. 
        <br/>
        <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values?</strong><br/>
        My core values are being honest and reliable, standing up for others, and being considerate. 
        <br/>

        <strong>What do you stand for?</strong><br/>
            I stand for everyone being treated equally, and having the same opportunities. 
        <br/>
        <strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong><br/>
            I found reliving a failure harder than I expected, it was difficult to put myself fully in the thought process and situation that had happened previously, but it was good to reflect on these emotions. The success was also difficult, as I have high expectations for myself, and it was difficult to think of one particular success.
        <br/>
        <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br/>
            I enjoyed reading some of the stories around writing your obituary, and making mistakes. I think it's important to think about our legacys, and how we can achieve our future goals, and take chances.
