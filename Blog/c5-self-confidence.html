            <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong><br/>
            Mindfulness and self-awareness have been suggested to be essentially the same thing in this chapter. I can agree with this, thinking about my understanding of these concepts, or at the very least they are very related.
            <br/>
            <strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong><br/>
            Body scanning is a practice I am familiar with from Yoga. I often use this technique already when I’m having trouble sleeping, and find this helps, as mentioned in this chapter. For this reason, I tried the Journaling practice, as I haven’t tried this before. I think it was easy to write things down knowing it was for my eyes only, and I could be more honest with myself. It felt good to acknowledge how I was feeling, and I had a sense of empowerment and motivation with some of the negative things I wrote about. I felt motivated to change these, and  avoid having to write about them in the future, especially when I didn’t need to feel that way about a particular thing, but I chose to have that type of reaction.
            <br/>
            This seems like a simple concept, but is something a lot of people overlook. I like that this gives a logical sense to our emotions, and teaches us not to judge one another from our emotions. It also highlights how some people can appear to react differently to an event, when one person could really just have better control of their emotions, and so it’s hard to judge one another in this respect. I enjoyed the last point about how important this understanding is to change, which I really agree with.
            <strong> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong><br/>
