        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        <p>
            A grid based design is a grid framework, 
            that allows elements to be easily structured and added in the same manner as a typical grid. 
            This can include using rows and columns, and using sections fo the grid for different 
            purposes, i.e. Headers, Footers, or standout elements.

        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
        <p>
            Responsive webpages are important when you think of the number of devices that people use today. 
            Because of the variation in devices, websites need to be able to reach as many people as possible 
            in the easiest way possible. Having a responsive website, allows a user to get the same information 
            they would on their pc, on their mobile, and have it be just as easy to understand and navigate.

        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
        <p>
            Semantic structure is where the html describes the meaning of the content it contains.
            For example, the 'header' tag is used at the beginning of a site, as this 'heads' the page. 
        </p>

        <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
        <p>
            I think the importance of the working through the framework in HTML 
            before diving into CSS is important. The resources such as placekitten.com can help keep 
            the framework build fun, without compromising the time used to build the framework.
