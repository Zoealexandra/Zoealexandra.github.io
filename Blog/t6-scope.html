        <strong> Explaining to a non-tech friend: What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.</strong><br/>
        Scope is the context of the your code, and is used to describe how you can see and access variables and functions.
        <br/>
        There are two types of scope in javascript, local and global. 
        <br/>
        Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of functions, and these can be accessed within any function within your code. 
        <br/>
        Local scope is specialised, and variables defined here are just for the use of the function they were created in. 
        You can’t call this variable outside of the function. 
        You could also reuse the name of the variable within another function, as they wouldn’t be linked. 
        Local scope includes something known as nested scope. This is when a function is declared within another function. The child function, can access the variables of the parent function, but the parent function cannot access the child function properties. 
        This could be thought of in the same way as one way mirrors, as the content branches out to it’s parent functions, it can see/access them fine, but the parents and then ultimately the global scope, can’t look back at them, they only see themselves or outward toward the global scope.
