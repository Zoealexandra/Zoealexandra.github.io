        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
        <p>Similar to the house analogy used by Udacity, a car could be used int he same way. There are basic necessities when it comes to building a car, 
            and there are certain rules or guidelines followed for the basic skeleton i.e. it needs some wheels. In terms of the CSS, this is where you can 
            choose the car colour, the interior specifics, or the types of wheeels for the car.
            The DOM is like the electrics throughout the car that pull it all together and get the ca to start. </p>
        <h2> What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
        <p>Boxifying design means to look at a design in terms of boxes, and create different sections using boxes, to help give it structure. </p>
        <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
        <p>The box model applys to all HTML elements, which are essentially all boxes. There are four sections to the box, th content, padding, border 
            and then the margin. Each play their own role in the design of an HTML element, and can be customised.  </p>
