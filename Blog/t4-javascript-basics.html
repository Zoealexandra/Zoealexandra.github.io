        <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong><br/>
        HTML and CSS could be described as more of a two-dimensional struture. HTML is like the the bones and basic elements
        required of a website. CSS then adds more dimension in terms of appearance and style.
        Javascript is more three-dimensional, using more interactive elements with the user, such as drop-down menus, or slideshows, or hiding content on a page.

        <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong><br/>
         One example of control flow could be deciding what to have for breakfast, if there is bread available, you will east this for breakfast. You will continue to have bread until
         all of the bread is gone. If there is no bread, you will have a banana instead. An if statement would be used here to figure out what you'll have, 
         if there is bread, you will eat the bread, or else, you will have a banana. 
         When eating the bread each day, a loop could be used to describe this. The loop is repeated, ie you eating bread, until the condition is met. That
         condition would be that the bread is all gone. Hopefully this helps explain how control flow and loops could be used to describe everyday decisions.

        <strong> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong><br/>
        When accessing data from an array, you need o specify where in the array the data is kept, as arrays are arranged in an orderly fashion. 
        Objects however, run on more of a label system, so you could find what you are looking for by writing in the data's label or "topic".
        <br/>
        <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong><br/>
            Functions are code used to perform tasks and can return values. In order for it to perform a task, it needs to be called, using a name in which it was defined.
            A Function only needs to be defined once, but are useful because they can be used multiple times once defined, which makes your code more efficient. 
            They're also useful in the way that you can provide the same function with different data, which can allow it to produce different results.
